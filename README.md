# <center>SET --- The Card Game</center>

## Current issue:
  * This implementation is only partially GUI-ified. Text appears in a GUI console-like window, but the user must still enter text in the console that launched the program.

## Selected TODO Items:
  * GUI: Implement the rest of the GUI.
  * GUI: Modify user prompts and input to the GUI (using JLabel & JTextArea).
  * Game option: Display current number of Sets on board.
  * Game option: Support a "mercy option": End the game if the deck is empty, and no more Sets are present.
  * Implementation: Change findSet to findSets, which can find all Sets on board.
  * Implementation: Refactor Game.main() into smaller pieces.
